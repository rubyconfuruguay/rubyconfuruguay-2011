    RubyConf Uruguay is the main conference organized in 2010 for the
    Ruby Community in the Spanish speaking part of South America. A
    regional conference which will draw many agile developers and
    companies. Developers in this region have extensive ties and clients
    in North America and Europe. It's a great place to find developers and
    promote products in the Spanish speaking ruby developer community.

  %p
    Beyond the sponsorship packages, if you have specific ideas, we'd be
    happy to talk about how you can be involved in sponsoring RubyConf
    Uruguay.
